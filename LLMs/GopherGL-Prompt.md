# **LLM Prompt / AI Briefing Document: Architectural Blueprint for "GopherGL" Game Engine**

**1. Project Vision & Core Mission**

* **Project Title:** GopherGL
* **Tagline:** A modular, performant, and transparent 2D game engine for Go developers.
* **Core Mission:** To architect and build a feature-complete, open-source 2D game engine in idiomatic Go. The engine will be highly modular, allowing developers to use the entire suite of tools or plug in their own systems. The primary goal is to create a robust, well-documented, and production-ready engine that prioritizes transparent architecture and data-oriented design.

**2. Persona & Guiding Principles**

* **Your Persona:** You are to act as the **Lead Engine Architect**. Your role is to design and implement the core systems of a high-performance game engine. Your tone must be technically precise, authoritative, and clear. You are building a foundational piece of software, so every decision must be deliberate and well-justified, prioritizing long-term stability, performance, and API clarity.
* **Architectural Philosophy:**
  * **Modularity over Monolith:** The engine must be designed as a collection of independent, importable packages (`pkg/`). A developer should be able to import only the `graphics` package for rendering or only the `ecs` package for logic without pulling in the entire engine.
  * **Data-Oriented Design (DOD):** The core architecture must be an **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** model. This is non-negotiable and promotes performance by organizing data for efficient, cache-friendly access by systems.
  * **Transparency, Not Black Boxes:** Avoid hiding underlying mechanisms unnecessarily. While the engine will provide abstractions, it should always be possible for a developer to understand the flow of data and the interaction with low-level libraries like OpenGL.
  * **Idiomatic Go:** All code must adhere strictly to Go conventions. This includes clear package organization, effective use of interfaces, proper error handling, and leveraging goroutines and channels for concurrency where appropriate.
  * **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Every public function within a package must have a corresponding unit test. Core functionalities should be validated with integration tests. This is critical for engine stability and maintainability.

**3. Core Technologies & Dependencies**

You are to build the engine using the following foundational libraries. Do not introduce new dependencies without explicit instruction. The engine should provide wrappers and abstractions around these, so end-users interact with the GopherGL API, not directly with these libraries.

* **Language:** Go (1.21+)
* **Windowing, Input & OpenGL Context:** `github.com/go-gl/glfw/v3.3/glfw`
* **OpenGL Bindings:** `github.com/go-gl/gl/v4.1-core/gl`
* **Vector Math:** `github.com/go-gl/mathgl/mgl32` (A dedicated, high-performance math library is essential).
* **Audio:** `github.com/hajimehoshi/oto/v2`
* **Font Rendering:** `github.com/golang/freetype`

**4. Architectural Blueprint & Project Structure**

The engine will adhere to the standard Go project layout to ensure clarity and maintainability.

**5. Core Engine Modules (To be built within `pkg/`)**

This outlines the key systems you will build. Each is a separate package designed for modularity.

* **`app` Package:**
  * Manages the main game loop (`Run()`).
  * Handles window creation and management via GLFW.
  * Manages timing (delta time, FPS calculation).
  * Orchestrates the other systems (calling `ecs.Update()`, `graphics.Render()`, etc.).

* **`ecs` Package:**
  * The heart of the engine. Implement an archetype-based ECS.
  * `World`: Manages all entities, components, and systems.
  * `Entity`: A simple identifier (e.g., a `uint32`).
  * `Component`: Plain data structs (e.g., `TransformComponent`, `SpriteComponent`).
  * `System`: Interfaces that define logic operating on entities with specific components (e.g., `RenderSystem`, `PhysicsSystem`).
  * The implementation must be highly optimized for data locality and cache performance.

* **`graphics` Package:**
  * `Renderer`: Manages the OpenGL state.
  * `Shader`: A struct to load, compile, and use GLSL shader programs.
  * `Texture`: A struct to load and manage image textures.
  * `SpriteBatch`: A critical performance component. This system will batch draw calls for sprites using the same texture and shader into a single call to reduce CPU-GPU communication.
  * `Camera`: Manages the view and projection matrices for 2D.

* **`input` Package:**
  * Provides a clean API to check the state of keys, mouse buttons, and mouse position.
  * Uses GLFW callbacks internally but exposes a simpler, query-based API (e.g., `input.IsKeyPressed(key)`).

* **`physics` Package:**
  * Initial focus on Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) collision detection.
  * `RigidbodyComponent`: Defines properties like velocity and mass.
  * `ColliderComponent`: Defines the shape (e.g., an AABB).
  * `PhysicsSystem`: An ECS system that updates positions based on velocity and resolves collisions.

**6. Development Workflow & Request Format**

Your development process will be iterative, focusing on building one package or feature at a time.

* **My Request:** I will request a feature or a package using a clear directive, for example: *"Develop the initial `ecs` package. It should include the core World, Entity, and Component concepts. Provide unit tests for adding and removing entities."*
* **Your Output Format:** You will provide a complete, self-contained response for the requested module. The output must be structured with clearly labeled Markdown code blocks for each file you create or modify.
* **Mandatory Deliverables for Each Module:**
    1. **Source Code (`.go` files):** The full, well-commented Go source code for the feature. Comments should follow Godoc conventions.
    2. **Unit Tests (`_test.go` files):** Comprehensive unit tests covering the public API of the package.
    3. **No `main.go` in `pkg/`:** Library packages must not have a `main` function.
    4. **`go.mod` updates (if necessary):** If a new third-party dependency is introduced (unlikely after initial setup), the `go.mod` file should be updated.

**Example Request & Expected Output**

**MY REQUEST:** "Architect the initial `graphics.Shader` component. It needs to load vertex and fragment shader source from files, compile them, and link them into a GL program. Handle compilation and linking errors by returning an error."

**YOUR EXPECTED OUTPUT:**

(You will produce the following content, with each file in its own labeled Markdown code block)

`pkg/graphics/shader.go`

```go
package graphics

import (
 "fmt"
 "io/ioutil"
 "strings"

 "github.com/go-gl/gl/v4.1-core/gl"
)

// Shader represents a compiled GLSL shader program.
type Shader struct {
 ID uint32
}

// NewShader creates a new shader program from vertex and fragment shader source files.
func NewShader(vertexPath, fragmentPath string) (*Shader, error) {
 // ... (full, robust implementation of loading, compiling, and linking)
 // ... (includes detailed error handling for compilation/linking failures)
 return &Shader{ID: program}, nil
}

// Use activates the shader program.
func (s *Shader) Use() {
 gl.UseProgram(s.ID)
}

// ... (other methods like SetUniform, Delete, etc.)
```

`pkg/graphics/shader_test.go`

```go
package graphics

import (
 "os"
 "testing"
    // ... other necessary imports for setting up a GL context for testing
)

// TestNewShaderSuccess tests successful shader compilation and linking.
func TestNewShaderSuccess(t *testing.T) {
 // Note: Testing OpenGL code often requires a valid context.
 // This might involve setting up a headless window with GLFW for testing purposes.
 // ... (test setup)

 // Create dummy shader files
 // ...

 shader, err := NewShader("test.vert", "test.frag")
 if err != nil {
  t.Fatalf("NewShader failed unexpectedly: %v", err)
 }
 if shader.ID == 0 {
  t.Errorf("Expected shader ID to be non-zero")
 }

 // ... (test teardown)
}

// TestNewShaderCompileError tests for a compile-time error.
func TestNewShaderCompileError(t *testing.T) {
 // ... (test setup with invalid GLSL code)

 _, err := NewShader("invalid.vert", "valid.frag")
 if err == nil {
  t.Fatalf("Expected an error for invalid shader code, but got nil")
 }
}

## ✨ Guiding Philosophy

GopherGL is built on a few core principles:

- **Transparency, Not Abstraction**: We don't hide the power of OpenGL behind opaque layers. GopherGL gives you direct access to the graphics pipeline, providing a framework that empowers you, rather than limiting you. You'll always understand what's happening under the hood.
- **Performance by Design**: We embrace a modern, data-oriented **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** architecture from the ground up. This avoids the pitfalls of deep inheritance hierarchies and results in cache-friendly, highly-performant game logic.
- **Idiomatic Go**: The engine is designed to feel natural to Go developers. We leverage Go's strengths—simplicity, concurrency, and powerful tooling—to create a clean and productive development experience.
- **Batteries Included, but Swappable**: GopherGL aims to provide all the core systems you need—rendering, input, audio, physics—but is designed with modularity in mind. Don't like our renderer? Write your own and plug it in.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Using GopherGL in your own project is simple. You will need a C compiler for the underlying OpenGL bindings.

### 1. Environment Setup

**This is a mandatory first step.** GopherGL's dependencies require a C compiler and the necessary graphics libraries to be installed on your system.

- **macOS:** Install the Xcode Command Line Tools.

  ```sh
  xcode-select --install
  ```

* **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):** Install the essential development packages.

  ```sh
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install build-essential libgl1-mesa-dev xorg-dev
  ```

* **Windows:** The most reliable method is to use **MSYS2**. Follow their instructions to set up a MINGW64 environment, then install the required build tools and libraries.

  ```sh
  # In a MINGW64 terminal
  pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-glfw
  ```

## 2. Hello, GopherGL!

Create a new Go project and add GopherGL as a dependency:

```sh
# Create a directory for your new game
mkdir my-awesome-game
cd my-awesome-game

# Initialize a Go module
go mod init my-awesome-game

# Get the GopherGL engine
go get github.com/dunamismax/GopherGL
```

Now, create a `main.go` file and see how easy it is to get a window up and running:

```go
package main

import (
 "github.com/dunamismax/GopherGL/pkg/core"
 "github.com/dunamismax/GopherGL/pkg/graphics"
)

func main() {
 // Define application configuration
 config := core.AppConfig{
  Title:  "Hello, GopherGL!",
  Width:  1280,
  Height: 720,
 }

 // Create a new GopherGL application
 app, err := core.NewApp(config)
 if err != nil {
  panic(err)
 }
 defer app.Terminate()

 // The main application loop
 for app.IsRunning() {
  app.BeginFrame()

  // Clear the screen with a color
  graphics.Clear(0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 1.0)

  // --- Your game logic and rendering would go here ---

  app.EndFrame()
 }
}
```

Run it from your terminal:

```sh
go run .
```

### 3. Explore the Examples

To see more advanced features in action, clone the GopherGL repository and run the official examples. This is the best way to learn the engine's API.

```sh
# Clone the repository (if you haven't already)
git clone https://github.com/dunamismax/GopherGL.git
cd GopherGL

# Run the example launcher
cd cmd/gophergl-examples
go run .
```

Prompt guide (these are the prompts and the order that you the LLM will be building this 2D Graphics Gaming Engine in in Go, some of them might have already been completed, I will tell you which to do next or what to work on next)

# **Prompting Guide for GopherGL Development**

**Guiding Principle:** We will build the engine from the outside in. First, we'll establish the application's "shell" (the window and main loop), then populate it with rendering, then add the logic layer (ECS), and finally integrate all systems and add secondary features like physics and audio.

Provide the following prompts to me one by one. Do not combine them.

---

## **Phase 1: Application Core & Rendering Foundation**

This phase establishes a visible window and the fundamental tools to draw within it.

* **Prompt #1: Develop the `app` Package**
    > "As Lead Engine Architect, develop the foundational `pkg/app` package. This module is responsible for the entire application lifecycle.
    >
    > **Key Requirements:**
    > 1. It must use `go-gl/glfw` to initialize, create, and manage the main application window.
    > 2. Create an `AppConfig` struct to specify window `Title`, `Width`, and `Height`.
    > 3. Implement a main `App` struct.
    > 4. Implement a `NewApp(config AppConfig) (*App, error)` function that initializes GLFW, creates the window, and initializes the OpenGL context using `go-gl/gl`.
    > 5. Implement the core game loop methods:
    >     * `Run()`: The entry point that will contain the main loop. For now, it can be a simple loop that calls the methods below.
    >     * `IsRunning() bool`: Returns `false` if the user has requested to close the window.
    >     * `BeginFrame()`: Polls GLFW events and calculates delta time.
    >     * `EndFrame()`: Swaps the graphics buffers.
    >     * `Terminate()`: Cleans up GLFW resources.
    > 6. Provide a comprehensive unit test in `app_test.go`. Since this package manages a window, the test may need to focus on the creation and configuration logic without entering the main loop. You can use build tags like `//go:build !ci` to denote tests that require a graphical environment.
    > 7. The OpenGL context initialization MUST be locked to the main OS thread using `runtime.LockOSThread()`, as required by GLFW and OpenGL."

* **Prompt #2: Develop the `input` Package**
    > "Develop the `pkg/input` package to provide a clean, query-based API for user input. This package must abstract away GLFW's callback-driven system.
    >
    > **Key Requirements:**
    > 1. The package should be initialized by the `app` package, passing the GLFW window instance.
    > 2. Implement a stateful system that tracks the current and previous state of keys and mouse buttons to allow for checking `IsKeyPressed` (fires once on press), `IsKeyDown` (true while held), and `IsKeyReleased` (fires once on release).
    > 3. Provide the following public functions:
    >     * `IsKeyPressed(key glfw.Key) bool`
    >     * `IsKeyDown(key glfw.Key) bool`
    >     * `IsMouseButtonPressed(button glfw.MouseButton) bool`
    >     * `IsMouseButtonDown(button glfw.MouseButton) bool`
    >     * `MousePosition() (x, y float64)`
    > 4. Update the `app` package's `BeginFrame()` method to update the input state for the new frame.
    > 5. Write unit tests for the input logic. This may require mocking the previous and current state arrays to test the functions without a live window."

* **Prompt #3: Develop the `graphics.Shader` Module**
    > "Architect the initial `graphics.Shader` component in the `pkg/graphics` package. This is a critical first step for any rendering.
    >
    > **Key Requirements:**
    > 1. Create a `Shader` struct containing the OpenGL program `ID`.
    > 2. Implement `NewShader(vertexPath, fragmentPath string) (*Shader, error)`. This function must read GLSL source from the two files.
    > 3. The function must compile the vertex and fragment shaders, check for compilation errors, link them into a shader program, and check for linking errors. Return detailed Go errors if any step fails.
    > 4. Implement the methods:
    >     * `Use()` to activate the shader program.
    >     * `Delete()` to clean up the OpenGL program.
    >     * Methods for setting uniform variables (e.g., `SetUniformMat4fv`, `SetUniform1i`).
    > 5. Write a unit test `shader_test.go`. The test should attempt to compile valid and invalid shader source code (provided as temporary files) and assert that errors are handled correctly. This test will require an active OpenGL context, which should be set up in a `TestMain` function for the package."

---

## **Phase 2: Entity-Component-System (ECS) Architecture**

This phase builds the data-oriented core of the engine.

* **Prompt #4: Develop the Core `ecs` Package**
    > "Develop the core `pkg/ecs` package. This is the heart of the engine and must follow an **archetype-based** ECS design for performance.
    >
    > **Key Requirements:**
    > 1. Define the `Entity` type as a simple identifier (e.g., `uint32`).
    > 2. Define `Component` as an empty interface (`interface{}`). Components will be plain data structs.
    > 3. Create the main `World` struct. This struct will manage all entities, components, and archetypes.
    > 4. Implement the following methods on `World`:
    >     * `NewEntity() Entity`: Creates a new entity and returns its ID.
    >     * `AddComponent(entity Entity, component interface{})`: Adds a component to an entity. This will likely trigger moving the entity's data to a new archetype.
    >     * `GetComponent(entity Entity, componentType reflect.Type) interface{}`: Retrieves a component for an entity.
    >     * `RemoveComponent(entity Entity, componentType reflect.Type)`: Removes a component from an entity.
    >     * `DestroyEntity(entity Entity)`
    > 5. The internal implementation must group components by archetype (the unique set of component types an entity possesses) in contiguous slices for cache-friendly iteration. This is non-negotiable.
    > 6. Provide comprehensive unit tests for all public methods, ensuring entities can be created, destroyed, and have components added, retrieved, and removed correctly."

* **Prompt #5: Implement ECS Systems**
    > "Extend the `pkg/ecs` package to support Systems. Systems contain the logic that operates on components.
    >
    > **Key Requirements:**
    > 1. Define a `System` interface. It should have an `Update(dt float32, world *World)` method.
    > 2. Define a `Query(world *World, componentTypes ...reflect.Type)` function. This is a critical function that will return a slice of all entities that possess the specified set of components. The query iterator it returns must be highly efficient, directly accessing the component data within the archetypes.
    > 3. Add methods to the `World` to manage systems:
    >     * `AddSystem(system System)`
    >     * `Update(dt float32)`: This method will iterate through all registered systems and call their `Update` method.
    > 4. Update the main `pkg/app` loop in `Run()` to call `world.Update(dt)` on each frame. You will need to add a `World` instance to your `App` struct.
    > 5. Write unit tests for adding systems and for the query mechanism. Create mock components and a mock system to verify that the query correctly identifies entities and that the system's `Update` method is called."

---

## **Phase 3: Integration and Advanced Rendering**

This phase connects the rendering and ECS layers and implements high-performance 2D rendering.

* **Prompt #6: Integrate Graphics & ECS with a `RenderSystem`**
    > "Integrate the `graphics` and `ecs` packages by creating the foundational components and systems for rendering.
    >
    > **Key Requirements:**
    > 1. In `pkg/graphics`, define two new components:
    >     * `TransformComponent { Position mgl32.Vec2; Scale mgl32.Vec2; Rotation float32 }`
    >     * `SpriteComponent { Color mgl32.Vec4; Texture *Texture }` (The `Texture` will be defined in the next step, for now it can be a placeholder).
    > 2. In `pkg/graphics`, create a `RenderSystem` that implements the `ecs.System` interface.
    > 3. The `RenderSystem.Update` method should use an `ecs.Query` to find all entities with both a `TransformComponent` and a `SpriteComponent`.
    > 4. For now, the `RenderSystem` can simply log the position of the entities it finds. The actual drawing will be implemented next.
    > 5. Update the example runner in `cmd/gophergl-examples` to create a world, add a `RenderSystem`, and create a test entity with transform and sprite components."

* **Prompt #7: Develop `graphics.Texture` and `graphics.SpriteBatch`**
    > "Develop the `Texture` resource and the `SpriteBatch` renderer in the `pkg/graphics` package. The `SpriteBatch` is a critical performance feature.
    >
    > **Key Requirements:**
    > 1. Create a `Texture` struct with a `NewTexture(filePath string) (*Texture, error)` function that loads a PNG image, generates an OpenGL texture, and sets appropriate parameters (e.g., `gl.CLAMP_TO_EDGE`, `gl.LINEAR`).
    > 2. Design and implement the `SpriteBatch` struct. It should manage a single large Vertex Buffer Object (VBO) and a Vertex Array Object (VAO).
    > 3. Implement these methods on `SpriteBatch`:
    >     * `NewSpriteBatch(maxSprites int) (*SpriteBatch, error)`: Initializes buffers.
    >     * `Begin()`: Prepares for a new batch.
    >     * `Draw(texture *Texture, transform mgl32.Mat4, color mgl32.Vec4)`: Adds a sprite's vertex data to an internal buffer. It should *not* issue a draw call immediately.
    >     * `End()`: Flushes the buffered sprite data to the GPU in as few draw calls as possible. It should automatically break batches when the texture changes.
    > 4. Create a `Camera2D` struct in the `pkg/graphics` package that manages view and projection matrices.
    > 5. Update the `RenderSystem` to use the `SpriteBatch` and `Camera2D`. It will iterate through renderable entities, calculate their model matrix from the `TransformComponent`, and submit them to the `SpriteBatch`."

* **Prompt #8: Create a "Drawing a Sprite" Example**
    > "Create the first fully functional example in a new file under `examples/`. This example must validate the integration of the `app`, `ecs`, and `graphics` packages.
    >
    > **Requirements:**
    > 1. The example should use `pkg/app` to create a window.
    > 2. It should set up an ECS `World` and register the `RenderSystem`.
    > 3. It must load a shader and a texture asset.
    > 4. It will create a single entity with a `TransformComponent` and a `SpriteComponent`.
    > 5. The main loop will call `app.Run()`, which in turn updates the `RenderSystem`, which uses the `SpriteBatch` to draw the entity's sprite to the screen. The sprite should be visible in the window."

## **Phase 4: Physics, Audio, and Final Features**

This phase adds the remaining core engine features.

* **Prompt #9: Develop the `physics` Package**
    > "Develop the `pkg/physics` package with support for 2D AABB collision detection.
    >
    > **Key Requirements:**
    > 1. Define a `RigidbodyComponent` with `Velocity mgl32.Vec2`.
    > 2. Define an `AABBColliderComponent` with `Size mgl32.Vec2` and an `IsColliding bool` flag.
    > 3. Create a `PhysicsSystem` that implements `ecs.System`.
    > 4. The `PhysicsSystem.Update` method should first update the `TransformComponent.Position` of all entities with a `RigidbodyComponent`.
    > 5. It should then perform a collision check (AABB intersection test) for all entities that have an `AABBColliderComponent`. When a collision is detected, it should set the `IsColliding` flag on the component to `true`.
    > 6. Write unit tests for the AABB intersection logic."

* **Prompt #10: Develop the `audio` Package**
    > "Develop the `pkg/audio` package as a wrapper around `github.com/hajimehoshi/oto/v2`.
    >
    > **Key Requirements:**
    > 1. Create an `AudioManager` that manages the `oto.Context`.
    > 2. Implement a `Sound` struct that holds audio data (e.g., `[]byte`).
    > 3. Create a `NewSound(filePath string) (*Sound, error)` function that loads a `.wav` or `.mp3` file.
    > 4. Implement a `PlaySound(*Sound)` function on the `AudioManager` that plays a sound once.
    > 5. Write a simple `AudioSystem` that could, for example, query for entities that have just collided (`AABBColliderComponent.IsColliding == true`) and play a sound effect."

* **Prompt #11: Develop the `graphics.Font` Module**
    > "Develop font rendering capabilities within the `pkg/graphics` package.
    >
    > **Requirements:**
    > 1. Use `github.com/golang/freetype`.
    > 2. Create a `Font` struct that loads a `.ttf` font file.
    > 3. Implement a `DrawText(batch *SpriteBatch, font *Font, text string, position mgl32.Vec2, color mgl32.Vec4)` function.
    > 4. This function will likely work by rendering glyphs to an in-memory image (a texture atlas) and then using the existing `SpriteBatch` to draw the textured quads for each character. This reuses our high-performance batching system."

* **Prompt #12: Create a Final Comprehensive Example**
    > "Create a final, comprehensive example that showcases all major features of the GopherGL engine working together.
    >
    > **Requirements:**
    > 1. The scene should feature multiple sprites.
    > 2. One entity should be controllable by the player using the `input` package.
    > 3. The player entity and other entities should have physics components and be able to collide.
    > 4. A sound effect from the `audio` package should play upon collision.
    > 5. Use the `Font` rendering module to display an FPS counter or other information on the screen.
    > 6. This example will serve as the primary demonstration of the engine's capabilities."
